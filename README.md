# CamInfo - Camera Transparency Labels

CamInfo is a community-led initiative to create standardized "Camera Nutrition Labels" that help individuals and organizations communicate the presence and capabilities of video cameras in a clear, accessible way.

## 🌟 About CamInfo

We're inspired by:
- The need for greater transparency about what modern camera systems can do
- A commitment to helping people understand how their faces and images are being captured
- The IoT Security & Privacy Label initiative led by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University
