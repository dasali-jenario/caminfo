# Getting Started with CamInfo

This guide will walk you through the process of creating and implementing your first camera transparency label.

## Step 1: Evaluate Your Camera System

Before creating a label, gather the following information about your camera:

- Does it record video? At what resolution?
- Does it record audio?
- Does it use motion detection or facial recognition?
- Where is data stored? (locally, cloud, etc.)
- How long is data retained?
- Who has access to the footage?
- What is the purpose of the camera?

## Step 2: Choose a Template

Visit our [templates directory](/templates) and select a template that fits your needs:

- **Basic templates**: Simple, easy to understand labels for standard cameras
- **Advanced templates**: More detailed labels for complex systems
- **Editable templates**: Customizable versions you can modify

## Step 3: Fill Out the Template

Complete all fields in the template with the information you gathered in Step 1. Be honest and transparent about your camera's capabilities.

**Tips for effective labels:**
- Use clear, non-technical language
- Be specific about data retention periods
- Include contact information for questions
- Avoid ambiguous terms like "may be used for" or "as needed"

## Step 4: Review Your Label

Before finalizing, verify that your label:
- Accurately represents your camera's capabilities
- Includes all required information
- Is easy to understand for non-technical people
- Complies with any applicable local regulations

## Step 5: Display Your Label

Choose an appropriate way to display your label:

- **Physical placement**: Print and post near the camera
- **Digital access**: Create a QR code linking to a digital version
- **Multiple formats**: Use both physical and digital methods

## Step 6: Update as Needed

Camera systems change over time. Update your labels when:
- Camera capabilities change
- Data practices are modified
- Retention policies change
- Contact information changes
